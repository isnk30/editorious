- You're building a very simple image editor with a clean UI and the latest version of nextjs.
- It should look like edit1.png.
- The recrangle in the center with the words "Place an image" can be clicked on and the user can choose an image from their computer to upload.
- Then it should look like edit2.png.
- The button with the settings icon should open a menu as seen in edit3.png.
- Each slider should control the propterty of the image named above the slider (hue, saturation, exposure).
- The button with the crop icon should allow the user to crop the image with handles on the sides of the image.
- Make sure to keep the image centered while the user is doing this.
- The icons in the bottom left corner should undo and redo actions respectively.
- The icon in the bottom right corner allows the user to download the edited image. 
- Build out this UI as accurately as possible.
- All icons should be from lucide.
